# Diagnostic Dimensions

Use these dimensions to assess infrastructure maturity (1.0 â†’ 2.5+):

- **Strategic Alignment:** Clear AI vision, 90-day priority, milestone cadence  
- **Data Accessibility:** Centralized access, governed sources, reliable refresh  
- **Workflow Clarity:** Documented sales/service/support flows; SLAs  
- **Tool Portfolio:** Purpose, cost, owner; overlap eliminated; deprecations tracked  
- **Decision Rights:** <$100, <$500, $500+ thresholds + approvers; test budget  
- **Rituals & Cadence:** Daily/weekly/monthly rhythms with owners & agendas  
- **Signals & ROI:** Time saved, adoption rate, cost % revenue, value created  
- **Connections:** Strong/broken/planned integrations & owners

**Scoring Tips**
- 1 = fragmented, 2 = defined, 2.5+ = orchestrated
- Attach one metric + one owner per gap
