## Purpose
The canvas helps teams:
- Audit **current AI tools** and how they’re connected
- Identify **gaps** in data flow, decision support, and team adoption
- Align AI investments with **business objectives**
- Create a **coherent operating model** instead of a fragmented tool stack

## How to Use

1. **Map Your Tools**  
   Document all AI and non-AI tools your organization currently uses.  
   Place them in the relevant functional blocks.

2. **Identify Infrastructure Layers**  
   Align tools and processes with the **Three Symbioses™**:  
   - **Cognitive** (decision-making, insights, AI reasoning)  
   - **Operational** (process automation, workflow orchestration)  
   - **Strategic** (alignment with long-term goals and market position)

3. **Spot Gaps**  
   Highlight areas with redundancy, missing connections, or unclear ownership.

4. **Plan Interventions**  
   Define experiments, integrations, or retirements to strengthen your model.
