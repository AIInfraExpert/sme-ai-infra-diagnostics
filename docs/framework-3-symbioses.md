# The 3 Symbioses Framework

A leadership system for building **living** AI organizations:

1. **Cognitive Symbiosis** — How the org learns (signals, analysis, decision memory)
2. **Operational Symbiosis** — How the org executes (workflows, automations, tools)
3. **Strategic Symbiosis** — How the org evolves (bets, budgets, reviews, sunset rules)

## When to use it
- Early AI adoption inside small/midsized orgs
- Too many tools, unclear ownership, no “why”
- Need a single view of strategy → systems → signals

## Outputs
- A single **operating model canvas**
- A small set of **metrics & rituals**
- A realistic **12-month roadmap** with owners

# The Three Symbioses™ Framework

**Purpose:** Align leadership, operations, and intelligence so AI adoption compounds instead of fragments.

## 1) Cognitive Symbiosis — How We Analyze
- **Owner:** Head of Strategy / RevOps
- **Inputs:** Data sources, weekly analysis rhythm, decision briefs
- **Outputs:** Insights, experiments, KPIs to watch
- **Anti-pattern:** Ad-hoc analysis in 4 tools; no single source of truth

## 2) Operational Symbiosis — How We Execute
- **Owner:** COO / Ops Lead
- **Inputs:** Core workflows (Sales, Service, Support), SLAs, rituals
- **Outputs:** Delivery reliability, cycle time, time saved, adoption
- **Anti-pattern:** Work happening in Slack/DMs with no repeatable flow

## 3) Strategic Symbiosis — How We Evolve
- **Owner:** CEO / GM / PMO
- **Inputs:** Decision rights, test budget, sunset policy, milestone cadence
- **Outputs:** Roadmap clarity, de-risked bets, fewer zombie tools
- **Anti-pattern:** Tool sprawl, unowned spend, “pilot purgatory”

## Using the Framework
1. Map current state (owners, rhythms, gaps)
2. Set 90-day priority and 12-month targets
3. Track signals weekly (adoption, time saved, ROI)
4. Prune or invest based on evidence

> Infra is the new strategy. Cohesion beats more tools.
